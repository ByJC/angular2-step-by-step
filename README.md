# angular2-step-by-step
angular2-step-by-step is a repository where I describe a way to create a nice and elegant angular 2 application.

In fact, we can find tons of angular2-boilerplate, using many packages and different configurations. this boilerplates are great for people who has already a great understanding of the ecosystem.
But for thoses who don't have that knowledge, it could be useful to learn it step by step.

I want to create a full-feature Angular2 project/boilerplate starting totally from scratch and little by little, add more packages and configuration (explained in details)

Each step will have a branch which describe how to do it.
